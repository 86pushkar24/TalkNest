// =====================================
// AUTHENTICATION MIDDLEWARE - JWT TOKEN VERIFICATION
// =====================================
// This middleware provides authentication protection for all secured routes
// in the TalkNest chat application. It validates JWT tokens from HTTP cookies
// and extracts user identity for downstream route handlers.
//
// Key Responsibilities:
// 1. Extract JWT tokens from HTTP-only cookies
// 2. Verify token signature and expiration
// 3. Extract user ID from valid tokens
// 4. Attach user identity to request object
// 5. Control access to protected resources
// 6. Handle authentication errors gracefully
//
// Security Features:
// - JWT signature verification using secret key
// - Token expiration checking
// - Secure cookie-based token transmission
// - Centralized authentication logic
// - Protection against token tampering
//
// Usage: Applied to routes requiring user authentication
// Example: router.get('/protected-route', verifyToken, handlerFunction)

// JWT TOKEN VERIFICATION MIDDLEWARE
// =====================================

/**
 * Middleware to verify JWT authentication tokens
 * 
 * This middleware function intercepts requests to protected routes and validates
 * the user's authentication status. It extracts the JWT token from cookies,
 * verifies its authenticity, and makes user identity available to route handlers.
 * 
 * @param {Object} req - Express request object
 * @param {Object} req.cookies - HTTP cookies containing JWT token
 * @param {Object} res - Express response object  
 * @param {Function} next - Express next middleware function
 * 
 * Authentication Flow:
 * 1. Extract 'jwt' cookie from request
 * 2. Verify token exists (user is logged in)
 * 3. Verify token signature and expiration
 * 4. Extract user ID from token payload
 * 5. Attach userID to request for downstream handlers
 * 6. Call next() to continue to protected route
 * 
 * On Success:
 * - req.userID contains authenticated user's database ID
 * - Request proceeds to intended route handler
 * - User can access protected functionality
 * 
 * On Failure:
 * - 401 Unauthorized response sent to client
 * - Request is terminated (next() not called)
 * - User must re-authenticate to access resource
 * 
 * Security Considerations:
 * - Tokens are verified using server's secret key
 * - Expired tokens are automatically rejected
 * - Invalid signatures indicate tampering attempts
 * - Missing tokens suggest unauthenticated access
 * 
 * Route Protection Examples:
 * - Message history retrieval
 * - Profile updates  
 * - File uploads
 * - Socket connection authentication
 * - User information access

        // - payload.exp: Token expiration timestamp
        
        // Continue to the protected route handler

    // MIDDLEWARE INTEGRATION NOTES
    // =====================================
    
    // This middleware is typically applied to routes like:
    // - GET /api/messages/get-messages (message history)
    // - POST /api/auth/update-profile (profile updates)
    // - POST /api/messages/upload-file (file uploads)
    // - GET /api/auth/user-info (user data retrieval)
    
    // Socket.io authentication uses similar logic:
    // - Extracts userID from query params during connection
    // - Could be enhanced to use this same verification logic
    
    // Error handling considerations:
    // - 401 responses should trigger frontend logout/redirect
    // - Expired tokens should prompt re-authentication
    // - Multiple failed attempts might indicate attack
}
