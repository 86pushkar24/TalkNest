/**
 * TalkNest BACKEND SERVER - Main Entry Point
 * 
 * This is the core server file that bootstraps the entire TalkNest real-time chat application backend.
 * It sets up Express.js server, MongoDB connection, middleware stack, API routes, and Socket.IO integration.
 * 
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - Database connection management
 * - Express server configuration and middleware setup
 * - CORS policy configuration for frontend-backend communication
 * - Static file serving for uploaded content (profiles, files)
 * - API route registration for all feature modules
 * - Socket.IO server initialization for real-time messaging
 * - Production-ready server startup with proper error handling
 * 
 * Architecture Pattern: Modular backend with clear separation of concerns
 * - Routes handle HTTP endpoints
 * - Controllers contain business logic
 * - Models define data structure
 * - Socket.js handles real-time communication
 * 
 * @fileoverview Main server entry point for TalkNest chat application

 * - methods: Allowed HTTP methods for API operations
 * - credentials: Enables sending cookies (required for JWT auth)

 * - Files should be scanned for malware in production
 * - Consider implementing access control for sensitive files
 * - Set appropriate cache headers for performance

 *

 * - /api/auth/*      - User authentication (signup, login, profile management)
 * - /api/contacts/*  - Contact discovery and friend management
 * - /api/messages/*  - Message sending, receiving, and file uploads
 * - /api/channel/*   - Channel/group chat creation and management

 * Each route module contains its own controller logic and validation.

/**
 * ü§î KEY DESIGN THINKING QUESTIONS FOR SERVER ARCHITECTURE
 * 
 * As you extend and scale this backend server, consider these important questions:
 * 
 * 1. **SCALABILITY & PERFORMANCE**: 
 *    How would you handle increased load and concurrent users? Would you implement:
 *    - Horizontal scaling with load balancers and multiple server instances?
 *    - Database connection pooling and query optimization?
 *    - Redis for session storage and Socket.IO adapter for multi-server communication?
 *    - CDN for static file serving and caching strategies?
 * 
 * 2. **SECURITY & COMPLIANCE**:
 *    What additional security measures should be implemented for production?
 *    - Rate limiting to prevent API abuse and DDoS attacks?
 *    - Input validation and sanitization middleware?
 *    - HTTPS enforcement, security headers, and CSP policies?
 *    - Audit logging for compliance and security monitoring?
 * 
 * 3. **ERROR HANDLING & MONITORING**:
 *    How would you improve error handling and system observability?
 *    - Global error handling middleware with structured logging?
 *    - Health check endpoints for different services (DB, Redis, etc.)?
 *    - Application performance monitoring (APM) and alerting?
 *    - Graceful shutdown handling for zero-downtime deployments?
 * 
 * 4. **CONFIGURATION & DEPLOYMENT**:
 *    How would you make the application more deployment-ready and configurable?
 *    - Configuration validation and environment-specific settings?
 *    - Docker containerization and orchestration (Kubernetes)?
 *    - CI/CD pipeline integration with automated testing?
 *    - Blue-green or rolling deployment strategies?
 * 
 * 5. **API DESIGN & VERSIONING**:
 *    How would you evolve the API while maintaining backward compatibility?
 *    - API versioning strategy (URL path, headers, or query parameters)?
 *    - OpenAPI/Swagger documentation and automated testing?
 *    - GraphQL adoption for more flexible client queries?
 *    - Webhook system for external integrations and notifications?
