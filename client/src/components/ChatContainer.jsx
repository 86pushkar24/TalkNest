/**
 * ChatContainer.jsx
 * 
 * Main container component that orchestrates the chat interface layout.
 * This component provides the structural foundation for the chat experience,
 * organizing the three primary chat interface sections vertically.
 * 
 * Component Architecture:
 * - ChatHeader: Shows current conversation info, participants, and actions
 * - MessageContainer: Displays the scrollable message history
 * - MessageBar: Input area for composing and sending new messages
 * 
 * Layout Behavior:
 * - Mobile: Fixed positioning, full viewport coverage
 * - Desktop: Flexible layout that adapts to parent container
 * - Uses CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive chat interface
 * 
 * State Management:
 * - No local state - acts as pure layout container
 * - Child components manage their own state and data
 * - Relies on global state (Zustand) for chat data

 * Chat Container Component
 *

 * Layout Structure:
 * - Full viewport height with fixed positioning on mobile
 * - Responsive design that adapts to desktop sidebar layout
 * - Dark theme background matching the app's color scheme

/**
 * =============================================================================
 * KEY DESIGN THINKING QUESTIONS FOR CHAT CONTAINER
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * 1. LAYOUT ADAPTABILITY:
 *    How can this container better adapt to different screen sizes and orientations?
 *    Should we implement dynamic height calculations or more sophisticated responsive design?
 *    Consider: split-screen modes, tablet landscape, foldable devices.
 * 
 * 2. COMPONENT COMPOSITION:
 *    Should this container support more flexible component composition?
 *    Could we allow custom arrangements or additional components (sidebars, toolbars)?
 *    Consider: plugin architecture, customizable layouts, and modular design.
 * 
 * 3. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
 *    How can we optimize rendering performance when messages or participants change?
 *    Should we implement virtualization or memoization strategies?
 *    Consider: React.memo, component splitting, and render optimization.
 * 
 * 4. ACCESSIBILITY COMPLIANCE:
 *    How can we ensure this container meets accessibility standards (WCAG)?
 *    Should we add ARIA labels, focus management, or keyboard navigation support?
 *    Consider: screen readers, keyboard-only users, and accessibility testing.
 * 
 * 5. ANIMATION & TRANSITIONS:
 *    Should we add smooth transitions when switching between conversations?
 *    How can we enhance the user experience with meaningful animations?
 *    Consider: slide transitions, fade effects, and loading states.
