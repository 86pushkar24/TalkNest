/**
 * Chat.jsx
 * 
 * Main chat application component that serves as the primary interface
 * for the TalkNest real-time messaging experience. This component manages
 * the overall chat layout and handles user authentication flow.
 * 
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - Validates user profile completion and redirects if needed
 * - Manages the main chat interface layout (contacts + chat area)
 * - Conditionally renders chat or empty state based on selection
 * - Provides the foundation for real-time messaging functionality
 * 
 * Layout Architecture:
 * - Two-pane layout: ContactsContainer (sidebar) + Chat/Empty area
 * - Responsive design that works across desktop and mobile devices
 * - Uses Zustand global state for chat selection and user management
 * 
 * Authentication Flow:
 * - Checks for profile completion on mount
 * - Redirects to profile setup if incomplete
 * - Shows toast notifications for user guidance

/**
 * =============================================================================
 * KEY DESIGN THINKING QUESTIONS FOR MAIN CHAT COMPONENT
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * 1. USER ONBOARDING & PROFILE FLOW:
 *    How can we improve the profile setup experience and reduce abandonment?
 *    Should we implement progressive profile completion or guided tours?
 *    Consider: step-by-step onboarding, profile completion incentives, and user analytics.
 * 
 * 2. LAYOUT FLEXIBILITY & CUSTOMIZATION:
 *    Should users be able to customize the chat interface layout?
 *    How can we support different productivity workflows and preferences?
 *    Consider: resizable panels, collapsible sidebars, multi-window support, and saved layouts.
 * 
 * 3. REAL-TIME CONNECTION MANAGEMENT:
 *    How should we handle network connectivity issues and reconnection?
 *    Should we show connection status, offline indicators, or retry mechanisms?
 *    Consider: connection quality indicators, offline mode, message queuing, and user feedback.
 * 
 * 4. MULTI-CONVERSATION SUPPORT:
 *    Should we support multiple simultaneous conversations (tabs, split view)?
 *    How can we help users manage context switching between conversations?
 *    Consider: conversation tabs, split-screen mode, conversation history, and notification management.
 * 
 * 5. ACCESSIBILITY & INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT:
 *    How can we ensure the chat interface works for users with disabilities?
 *    Should we support RTL languages, screen readers, and keyboard navigation?
 *    Consider: ARIA labels, keyboard shortcuts, language detection, and cultural communication patterns.
